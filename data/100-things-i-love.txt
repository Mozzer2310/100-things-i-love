your smile
your laugh
your selflessness
your appreciation for the world
the way you speak to me
how safe you make me feel
how proud you make me
how good you make me feel about myself
your honesty
the way you say 'nothing's wrong' when there really is
how you have opened up to me
when you go MAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
how your yawns never fail to make me yawn
when you sing and dance
your eyes
your understanding
your compasion for people in your life
your forgetfulness when it comes to telling me key moments
the way you make me laugh
your sacrifice
the head scratches you give me
your hair
when your hair falls on my face
how you have accepted I'm rubbish at tucking your hair behind your ear
your strength
your jokes
your interest in my interests
your relationship with my family
your communication
how you look at me
how you feel in my arms
the confidence you give me
how you compliment me
how you make me a better man
the way you fall asleep in my arms
your scent you leave on my skin
your ability to see the good in people
your support
your confidence
that regardless of how you are feeling you see how I am feeling
the slurp noise you make whenever I burp
your decisiveness 
your indecisiveness
how you always order better food than me
how you handle situations
the sense of calm you bring me
when your things fill up my room
how you are yourself with me
when you are silly
when you call me
how you talk about me to other people
your beauty
that you are my bestfriend
your skin
that you make be nervous
when you tell me you love me
when you talk about our future
when you tell me off
that you are vulnerable with me
that you believe in me
when you let me pick the movie
when you finally pick the movie
your gentleness
your dedication
to hear about your day
the way you encourage me to spend time with my family and friends
falling asleep with you
looking back at pictures of you
that you fill my thoughts
your little updates throughout the day
that you enjoy hearing about my day
every moment we spend together
watching you get ready when we are going out
when you leave something at my house
making you laugh
when you make me laugh
when you deny that you are crying
our TikTok time that you created
your desire to do new things together
when we do absolutely nothing together
binge watching a show with you
how you take care of me
that you let me take care of you
your touch
the sound of your voice
feeling heartbeat when I lay on your chest
the warmth of your character
the warmth of your body
your FREEZING feet
the way you hold my arm
your spontaneousness
your outlook on life
your joy
that you do not tolerate bullshit
your gorgeous face
your sexy body
your stunning looks
your irresistable nature
the way you make me drawn to you
you, Jade. I love you!
