your smile
your laugh
your selflessness
your appreciation for the world
the way you speak to me
how safe you make me feel
how proud you make me
how good you make me feel about myself
your honesty
the way you say 'nothing's wrong' when there really is
how you have opened up to me
when you go MAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
how your yawns never fail to make me yawn
when you sing and dance
your eyes
your understanding
your compasion for people in your life
your forgetfulness when it comes to telling me key moments
the way you make me laugh
your sacrifice
the head scratches you give me
your hair
when your hair falls on my face
how you have accepted I'm rubbish at tucking your hair behind your ear
your strength
your jokes
your interest in my interests
your relationship with my family
your communication
how you look at me
how you feel in my arms
the confidence you give me
how you compliment me
how you make me a better man
the way you fall asleep in my arms
your scent you leave on my skin
your ability to see the good in people
your support
your confidence
that regardless of how you are feeling you see how I am feeling
the slurp noise you make whenever I burp
your decisiveness 
your indecisiveness
how you always order better food than me
how you handle situations
the sense of calm you bring me
when your things fill up my room
how you are yourself with me
when you are silly
when you call me
how you talk about me to other people
your beauty
that you are my bestfriend
your skin
that you make be nervous
when you tell me you love me
when you talk about our future
when you tell me off
that you are vulnerable with me
that you believe in me
when you let me pick the movie
when you finally pick the movie
your gentleness
your dedication
to hear about your day
the way you encourage me to spend time with my family and friends
